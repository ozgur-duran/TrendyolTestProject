 <h2>TrendyolTestProject</h2>
<p>Trendyol Test Project is an automation project developed using NUnit Framework and Selenium Web Driver. </p>
<p>The project uses the Page Object Model (POM) structure, allowing for easy modification of XPath codes and class names by creating separate classes in the Collections file for each page, which contain the properties that can be modified when the XPath codes change.</p>

To run the project on your computer, you need to check the version of the chromedriver. <p>If you encounter clicking errors such as ElementClickInterceptedException, you can check the XPath codes in the Collections file.</p>
